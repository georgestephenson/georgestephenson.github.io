### Hi! ðŸ‘‹
I'm George. I like to write code. Sometimes I play bass too.

I'm a professional software developer. Outside of work, my main focus right now is [reading a lot of textbooks](https://teachyourselfcs.com/). 

I'm inspired a lot by [recent developments](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generative_artificial_intelligence), so I want to make sure I have the CS and maths knowledge to understand it.
