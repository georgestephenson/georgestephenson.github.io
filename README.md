### Hi! ðŸ‘‹
I'm George. I like to write code. Sometimes I play bass too.

I'm a professional software developer working on closed source software. Right now I'm mostly using GitHub to track my self-study, for example following material recommended on [teachyourselfcs.com](https://teachyourselfcs.com/) and elsewhere.
